One of my favorite vacation places is Mexico. I really like the weather there because it never gets cold.
The people are very nice too. They never laugh at my bad Spanish.
The food is really good. Mexico City is a very interesting place to visit.
It has some great museums and lots of fascinating old buildings.
The hotels are too expensive to stay but there are more affordable options.
For example, you can stay at one of the beach resorts like Acapulco.
If you are planning to visit Mexico, you should definitely see the Mayan temples near Merida.
