"Yes" he exclaimed.
The rain stopped; the sun emerged.
"I'm sorry," she whispered.
Laughter erupted, filling the room!
"Wait" he shouted, running after her.
The bird chirped happily, a joyful melody?
"Goodbye," she sighed, waving goodbye.
The door slammed shut, echoing ominously.
"Help" he cried, desperation in his voice.
The cake blackened and inedible!!!
The baby cooed & pure innocence and joy.
"Thank you," she smiled gratefully.
The clock ticked time slipping away.
